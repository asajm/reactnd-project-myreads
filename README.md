This is a project for Udacity React Fundamentals course. The goal of this project is to build a front-end app by reactjs to manage my reading of books.

## How to start

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the project with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
